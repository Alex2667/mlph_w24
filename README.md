# Machine Learning and Physics -- Exercises (W24/25)

In this repository, you will find all material for the exercises to the Machine Learning and Physics lecture.

The conda environments needed to solve the exercises will be provided via a yaml-file for each sheet.

Note: If you git pull after locally editing, you might have to resolve merge conflicts.
You could avoid this by renaming the files before you edit them.
